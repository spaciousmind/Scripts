Links Rename Web or Ebook

JavaScript for Adobe InDesign

    Rename links and update
    Open source
    Adapt source code to create other scripts

Instructions for use

The script has no interface other than alert on launch to warn that files on disk will be altered, and alert when complete.

All links in the active InDesign document are renamed to eliminate spaces and punctuation that would require URL encoding. This prevents URLs that look like ".../This%20is%20the%20File%20Name.jpg". Instead such a link becomes ".../this-is-the-file-name.jpg".

The script is open source so it may be altered to suit other needs. For example, if lowercase is not desired, remove the change to lowercase. Other file name transformations can be added or removed, including to replace specific characters for a unique situation.

Localization

The script is open source. Users may alter the code to localize the language as desired.
