# 
# calendar Preset
#
# How this preset works:
# ----------------------
# Any values specified below will be applied after 
# the listCalendar GUI has closed but before the calendar is constructed.
# Thus a preset can be made that will override all or some of the parameters
# in the GUI; however, any parameter not overridded in the preset can be 
# controlled from the GUI.
#
# As an example for when this is useful.  There may be a standard layout with
# a specific page size, calendar placement and picture placement; howwever, sometimes
# the column order needs to be date then day, and other times it should be day then
# date.  With this model, the 'day-date' order setting is not included in the preset
# and can therefore be overridded; however, the page size and layout will always be 
# set to the values in the preset regardless of entries in the GUI.
#
# How To use this File:
# ---------------------
# Any text after a pound sign, "#", will be ignored.
# Parameters are defined as key/value pairs with the syntax key = value
# The keys and values need to be spelled correctly with the proper case.
# Commenting a key-value pair is a good way to keep visibility of the 
# setting, but not apply it.
